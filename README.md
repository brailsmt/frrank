# FRRank

FRRank is an application that will display FRC rankings throughout an FRC Robotics competition season.  The aim is to
provide teams a way to view and compare their performance with those of others teams.

## Why the silly name?

FRRank is derived from the words 'FIRST', 'Robotics', and 'Rank':  F.R.Rank or just frrank.
